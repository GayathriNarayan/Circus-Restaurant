# Future Improvements

## Ideas that we can implement but short on time

- Write a javascript for the events page. When we click on any of the events cards, it will redirect to the booking page. The script will also gather info about selected card and based on that alter the booking form.

- Write a javascript for the menu page that will generate the menu cards based on input. For instance we can define all the card items in an array of objects and each object could have keyes: name, price, image. In such case there would be no need to manually write all the html code for each and every cardeach time we have to add a new item to our menu. All the items can simply be generated with the script.

- Change styling of the generic alert messages from javascript by adding div elements for each message and also attaching eventListeners to enable buttons.
