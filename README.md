My recommendation is to keep the css/navbar-menu.css file intact because it is a bit long. Each time you have to implement some css styling, please do it in a way to create another css file within css/ directory and put all the things there. Also, once you add a new css file, it should be linked bellow link for navbar-menu.css.

The same goes for javascript. Each time you have to write something, please create another \*.js file within js/ directory.
